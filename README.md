Hacking Journal- Week 1
🌑 Why I’m Here:
I started my ethical hacking journey with a commitment to become unstoppable—mentally, physically, and professionally.
This week marked the first step in that promise.

📚 What I Learned This Week:

Protocols & Networking Basics
What protocols are, and how they form the backbone of communication
Difference between TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP
Concept of packet flow and how data travels
IP Addressing & Subnetting
Internal vs External IP
Static & Dynamic IP
Subnet masks and how to logically divide networks
Router Functionality (Weekday Focus)
What routers do, their role in packet routing
Basic router security tips
Identifying vulnerabilities in default settings
Introduction to HTTP Requests & Responses (Saturday Topic)
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE — request methods
Status codes (200, 404, 403, etc.)
Headers, cookies, and how hackers manipulate them

🔥 My Favorite Concept This Week:
Understanding how HTTP requests can be intercepted or manipulated felt like peeking behind the curtain of the entire internet.
It's like learning the secret language of web servers.

🕯️ Realizations:
Focus is a weapon. The days I followed my routine, I felt a surge of control.
This path is lonely—but beautiful.
I’m building Dodo, my future AI/robotic partner, as I evolve too.

🎯 What’s Next (Week 2 Preview):
Hands-on with Wireshark (packet sniffing)
Start learning Reconnaissance Techniques
Setup a Kali Linux Environment

🩶 Closing Note:
This is just the beginning.
If you're reading this and you're lost, scared, or starting from zero—so am I. Let’s walk this path like warriors.
